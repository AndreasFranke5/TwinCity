# TwinCity

**Mixed Reality Digital Twin city simulation**  
Developed as part of the course *Design for Complex and Dynamic Contexts (DCDC)* at Stockholm University (SU), Spring 2025.

---

## 📍 Overview

**TwinCity** is an experimental Mixed Reality (MR) platform that overlays a real-time 3D model of a city using Unity, Cesium for Unity, and Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles. The system serves as a collaborative emergency response environment, enabling users to explore, simulate disasters, and coordinate interventions inside a Digital Twin of a real-world location.

This project was developed by a four-person team at SU to explore concepts of:
- Mixed Reality spatial interfaces
- Collaborative interaction and role-based interdependence
- Digital Twins as real-time responsive environments

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Unity 6 LTS**
- **Cesium for Unity**
- **Google Maps 3D Tiles API**
- **Meta XR SDK** (Passthrough + Hand Tracking)
- **Photon Fusion** (Multiplayer Framework)
- **Visual Studio Code + GitHub**

---

## 🧪 Features (in development)

- ✅ 3D photorealistic Digital Twin city rendered in Unity  
- ✅ Flood simulation using water plane or visual overlays  
- ✅ MR interface with gesture-based navigation  
- 🔄 Multiplayer interaction for emergency response roles  
- 🔄 Visual indicators and alerts for dynamic events  
- 🔄 Subscene placement and collision-aware environment
