# TwinCity

** A simulation for Mixed Reality Digital Twin city! ** 

We are four master students for an academic group project in the course *Design for Complex and Dynamic Contexts (DCDC)* at Stockholm University in Spring 2025. In this project, we develop a collaborative tool, the Mixed Reality Emergency Response application, with a 3D digital twin city displayed on a physical table. Our project aims to allow users to visualize a city and ongoing emergency scenarios in a 3D map, improving their understanding of spatial context. Our project also enables to use of hand tracking in MR to rotate, zoom, and pan the city model naturally, as one would with a physical model. Lastly, our project aims to support multiple co-located users to view and manipulate the same city model together in real-time. Shared Spatial Anchors (SSA) ensure all users see the model in the exact same physical location on the table, and networking (Photo Fusion) syncs their interactions. These solutions help to fill the gaps of ineffective cooperation on different teams.

## 1.Introduction

TwinCity is an experimental Mixed Reality (MR) platform that integrates Unity, Cesium for Unity, and Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles to create a real-time 3D digital twin of urban environments. Designed as a collaborative emergency response tool, it enables users to simulate disasters, analyze impacts, and coordinate interventions within a dynamic virtual replica of real-world locations. As climate change increasingly disrupts lives, effective cross-departmental coordination is crucial. Unlike traditional tools, TwinCity enhances situational awareness by allowing teams to explore, collaborate, and analyze data in an immersive 3D space. Users can work together seamlessly to address environmental challenges, gain real-time insights from disaster zones, and optimize response strategies, thereby improving decision-making and operational efficiency.

TwinCity creates a high-fidelity virtual replica of physical cities, enabling stakeholders to visualize, analyze, and interact with geospatial data in an immersive 3D environment. The platform serves as a collaborative decision-support system for government agencies, disaster response teams, and urban planners. By integrating real-time IoT sensor data, environmental simulations, and multi-user interaction, TwinCity facilitates disaster preparedness & response in simulating floods, fires, and other emergencies in a risk-free virtual space. Climate Adaptation planning in modeling the impact of extreme weather events on urban infrastructure. Cross-departmental coordination in enabling real-time collaboration among emergency services, utilities, and policymakers.
