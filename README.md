# TwinCity

** A simulation for Mixed Reality Digital Twin city! ** 

We are four master students for an academic group project in the course *Design for Complex and Dynamic Contexts (DCDC)* at Stockholm University in Spring 2025. In this project, we develop a collaborative tool, the Mixed Reality Emergency Response application, with a 3D digital twin city displayed on a physical table. Our project aims to allow users to visualize a city and ongoing emergency scenarios in a 3D map, improving their understanding of spatial context. Our project also enables to use of hand tracking in MR to rotate, zoom, and pan the city model naturally, as one would with a physical model. Lastly, our project aims to support multiple co-located users to view and manipulate the same city model together in real-time. Shared Spatial Anchors (SSA) ensure all users see the model in the exact same physical location on the table, and networking (Photo Fusion) syncs their interactions. These solutions help to fill the gaps of ineffective cooperation on different teams.

## 1.Introduction

**TwinCity** is an experimental Mixed Reality (MR) platform that overlays a real-time 3D model of a city using Unity, Cesium for Unity, and Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles. The system serves as a collaborative emergency response environment, enabling users to explore, simulate disasters, and coordinate interventions inside a Digital Twin of a real-world location. This project was developed by a four-person team at SU to explore concepts of:
- Mixed Reality spatial interfaces
- Collaborative interaction and role-based interdependence
- Digital Twins as real-time responsive environments
